Such rates are of great importance for stochastic algorithms that are widely used in statistics and in computer science. They also have applications to analysis of card shuffling and other areas. In this paper, we attempt to describe various mathematical techniques that have been used to bound such rates of convergence. In particular, we describe eigenvalue analysis, random walks on groups, coupling, and minorization conditions. Connections are made to modern areas of research wherever possible. Elements of linear algebra, probability theory, group theory, and measure theory are used, but efforts are made to keep the presentation elementary and accessible.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach to optimal transport between graphs from the perspective of stationary Markov chains. A weighted graph may be associated with a stationary Markov chain by means of a random walk on the vertex set with transition distributions depending on the edge weights of the graph. After drawing this connection, we describe how optimal transport techniques for stationary Markov chains may be used in order to perform comparison and alignment of the graphs under study. In particular, we propose the graph optimal transition coupling problem, referred to as GraphOTC, in which the Markov chains associated to two given graphs are optimally synchronized to minimize an expected cost. The joint synchronized chain yields an alignment of the vertices and edges in the two graphs, and the expected cost of the synchronized chain acts as a measure of distance or dissimilarity between the two graphs. We demonstrate that GraphOTC performs equal to or better than existing state-of-the-art techniques in graph optimal transport for several tasks and datasets. Finally, we also describe a generalization of the GraphOTC problem, called the FusedOTC problem, from which we recover the GraphOTC and OT costs as special cases.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the bicausal optimal transport problem for Markov chains, an optimal transport formulation suitable for stochastic processes which takes into consideration the accumulation of information as time evolves. Our analysis is based on a relation between the transport problem and the theory of Markov decision processes. This way we are able to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality in the transport problem, as well as an iterative algorithm, namely the value iteration, for the calculation of the transportation cost. Additionally, we draw the connection with the classic theory on couplings for Markov chains, and in particular with the notion of faithful couplings. Finally, we illustrate how the transportation cost appears naturally in the study of concentration of measure for Markov chains.},

  abstract = 	 {Cross-domain alignment between two sets of entities (e.g., objects in an image, words in a sentence) is fundamental to both computer vision and natural language processing. Existing methods mainly focus on designing advanced attention mechanisms to simulate soft alignment, where no training signals are provided to explicitly encourage alignment. Plus, the learned attention matrices are often dense and difficult to interpret. We propose Graph Optimal Transport (GOT), a principled framework that builds upon recent advances in Optimal Transport (OT). In GOT, cross-domain alignment is formulated as a graph matching problem, by representing entities as a dynamically-constructed graph. Two types of OT distances are considered: (i) Wasserstein distance (WD) for node (entity) matching; and (ii) Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) for edge (structure) matching. Both WD and GWD can be incorporated into existing neural network models, effectively acting as a drop-in regularizer. The inferred transport plan also yields sparse and self-normalized alignment, enhancing the interpretability of the learned model. Experiments show consistent outperformance of GOT over baselines across a wide range of tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, image captioning, machine translation, and text summarization.}

abstract = {Graph matching, which refers to a class of computational problems of finding an optimal correspondence between the vertices of graphs to minimize (maximize) their node and edge disagreements (affinities), is a fundamental problem in computer science and relates to many areas such as combinatorics, pattern recognition, multimedia and computer vision. Compared with the exact graph (sub)isomorphism often considered in a theoretical setting, inexact weighted graph matching receives more attentions due to its flexibility and practical utility. A short review of the recent research activity concerning (inexact) weighted graph matching is presented, detailing the methodologies, formulations, and algorithms. It highlights the methods under several key bullets, e.g. how many graphs are involved, how the affinity is modeled, how the problem order is explored, and how the matching procedure is conducted etc. Moreover, the research activity at the forefront of graph matching applications especially in computer vision, multimedia and machine learning is reported. The aim is to provide a systematic and compact framework regarding the recent development and the current state-of-the-arts in graph matching.},
