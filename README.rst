Setup
-----

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   The main branch uses ``cuda11.8`` in its dependencies. If for some
   reason you need to use ``cuda12``, clone the ``cuda12`` branch
   instead

This package manages its dependencies via
`poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__. I recommend you install it
(otherwise if you prefer to manage them manually, a list of the
dependencies is available in the file ``pyproject.toml``)

When you have ``poetry``, you can add dependencies using our makefile

.. code:: console

   $ make .make/deps

or directly with poetry

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

Documentation
-------------

.. warning::
   Do not edit the documentation directly in the ``docs/`` folder,
   that folder is wiped every time the documentation is built. The
   static parts of the documentation can be edited in ``staticdocs/``.

You can build documentation and run tests using

.. code:: console

   $ make

Alternatively, you can build only the documentation using

.. code:: console

   $ make .make/build-docs

The documentation will be available in ``docs/build/html`` in the
readthedocs format

Running Experiments
-------------------

Running experiments requires installing development dependencies. This can be done by running

.. code:: console

   $ make .make/dev-deps

or alternatively

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install --with dev


`Experiments <experiments>`__ can be found in the ``experiments/``
directory (see `Project structure <#project-structure>`__ ).

The Barycenter and Coarsening experiments can be found in
``experiments/Barycenter.ipynb`` and ``experiments/Coarsening.ipynb``.
